     * 	  - S (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.
     * 	  - A is the addend for the relocation.
     * 	  - P is the address of the place being relocated (derived from r_offset).
     * 	  - Pa is the adjusted address of the place being relocated, defined as (P & 0xFFFFFFFC).
     * 	  - T is 1 if the target symbol S has type STT_FUNC and the symbol addresses a Thumb instruction; it is 0
     * 	    otherwise.
     * 	  - B(S) is the addressing origin of the output segment defining the symbol S. The origin is not required to be the
     * 	    base address of the segment. This value must always be word-aligned.
     * 	  - GOT_ORG is the addressing origin of the Global Offset Table (the indirection table for imported data
     * 	    addresses). This value must always be word-aligned. See §4.6.1.8, Proxy generating relocations.
     * 	  - GOT(S) is the address of the GOT entry for the symbol S.
     *
     * 	  X is the 32-bit result of normal relocation processing
