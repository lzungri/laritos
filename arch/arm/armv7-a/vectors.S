/**
 * From ARM documentation:
 *
 * When an exception is generated, the processor performs the following actions:
 *   - Copies the CPSR into the appropriate SPSR. This saves the current mode, interrupt mask,
 *     and condition flags.
 *   - Switches state automatically if the current state does not match the instruction set
 *     used in the exception vector table.
 *   - Changes the appropriate CPSR mode bits to:
 *   - Change to the appropriate mode, and map in the appropriate banked out registers for
 *     that mode.
 *   - Disable interrupts. IRQs are disabled when any exception occurs. FIQs are disabled
 *     when an FIQ occurs and on reset.
 *   - Sets the appropriate LR to the return address.
 *   - Sets the PC to the vector address for the exception.
