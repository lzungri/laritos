/**
 * From the ARM ARM document:
 *    In ARMv7, the single-copy atomic processor accesses are:
 *    • All byte accesses.
 *    • All halfword accesses to halfword-aligned locations.
 *    • All word accesses to word-aligned locations.
 *    • Memory accesses caused by a LDREXD/STREXD to a doubleword-aligned
 *      location for which the STREXD succeeds cause single-copy atomic
 *      updates of the doubleword being accessed.
 *
 *    NOTE:
 *      The way to atomically load two 32-bit quantities is to perform a
 *      LDREXD/STREXD sequence, reading and writing the same value, for
 *      which the STREXD succeeds, and use the read values.
